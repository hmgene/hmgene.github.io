The Institute of Medicine defines quality in healthcare as “the degree to which health services for individuals and populations increase the likelihood of desired health outcomes and are consistent with current professional knowledge.”[1]

Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA), Lean, and Six Sigma. 


5 overarching principles contribute to Lean methodology implementation:[9][6]
Identifying the value of a product or service to the customer, which could be the patient or another department in the hospital.
Value stream mapping is a visualization method of processes, materials, the flow of information, and resources involved in creating a product or service to identify those that add value and remove those that are wasted.[5][10]]
Creating flow by eliminating barriers.
Establishing pull based on actual customer demand rather than forecasted demand.
Establishing perfection means that in every system, efforts to eliminate waste are continuous and should always strive to meet or exceed customer or patient needs and satisfaction.

Six Sigma employs 2 methods:[17][14][8][4]

DMAIC or Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, and Control. DMAIC is used for improving current processes.
DMADV or Define, Measure, Analyze, Design, and Verify. DMADV is employed when developing new processes and products.
Different well-known quality improvement tools are used within the different phases of DMAIC or DMADV. Here are a few examples:[18][19][20][21]

Design of Experiments: An approach for projects that utilize a structured method of studying variables and outcomes. It may include randomization, established research approaches such as experimental or quasi-experimental, and statistical data analysis.
Cause and Effect Diagrams or Fishbone or Ishikawa Diagrams: A visualization of factors contributing to a given effect, such as prolonged length of stay.[22]
Control Chart: A graph that shows variation in data relative to a mean value and upper and lower limits.
Pareto Chart: Stemming from the 80/20 Pareto principle that 20% of factors cause 80% of the problems, is a bar chart showing the frequencies of factors in descending order from left to right to easily identify the most important factors.[22]
Root Cause Analysis (RCA): A multi-step process of identifying problems, reasons for the problem, and corrective actions after an adverse event occurs.
Failure Mode and Effect Analysis (FMEA): A process of identifying possible failure points in a process as a preventive way to address these weaknesses before they cause problems.
