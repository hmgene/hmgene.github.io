## Implementation
This app serves as an access point for the lab and others, offering:

- Support for the legacy Shiny app's back-calculation.
- Pre/post-processing functions to enhance workflow efficiency.
- A design that evolves to interact with AI agents.
- User communication through:
  - A central app.
  - A distributed app (via local Docker deployment). This acts as an agent to analyze user patterns and data through crowd-computation.

## Plan

- Dockerize (Command + App )
- Deploy @ Google Cloud (Authentication and Google Tools)
- Deveelop Client Docker (run at local computers and provide also resource power)
- Agent Model ( extract user info, and behavior with uploaded files )
