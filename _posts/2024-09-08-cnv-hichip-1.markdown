## Background
Depth of coverage (DOC), off-target CNV approaches have been applied to exome and ChIP-seq data [PMC9039557][PMC4396974].
DOC-off-target methods require filtering out peak regions when using non-input immunoprecipitation (IP) samples to avoid off-target binding signals. 
This ensures that only copy number enrichment unaffected by specific binding event, are retained. 
The peak calling outcomes are highly dependent on the specific algorithm used. 
Most ChIP-seq and ATAC-seq peak callers are not optimized for detecting complex, non-symmetric peak forms. 
For instance, H3K4me3 peaks are typically sharply localized, while H3K4me1/3 peaks span broader domains. H3K27ac marks both large regions, such as super-enhancers, and smaller, discrete regions like promoters, exhibiting both broad and narrow peak characteristics [35788238][ref..].
