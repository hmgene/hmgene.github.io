It was about 25 years ago, while I was in the army. 
I was watching a Japanese anime, Neon Genesis Evangelion, and I believed I could create impressive bionic weapons through DNA modification.
DNA modification is not new technology these days, but it is now used for creating drugs, not weapons.


As I studied the field of bioinformatics more deeply, I realized that biology is an information process. Although bioinformatics is often described as computational biology, involving the programming of algorithms and analyzing biological data, this is a limited and unremarkable explanation. Biological systems can be understood as systems that store, process, and transmit information, much like a computer processes data. As part of the universe, humans have developed this concept by creating computers, and we may have already known that we are mimicking this process in the digital world.

I believe in the concept of bio=information (a concept I developed), which could elevate bioinformaticians from secondary outsourcing technicians to real scientists. With this principle, 

With this principle, we can view many interesting phenomena through well-formed statistical descriptions, such as evolutionary models, which explain how an instance changes and maintains its status across generations and in different environments.

We will be able to explain any kind of information, whether biological or related to cryptocurrency, using bioinformatics concepts and models.

I think this is bioinformatics and bioinformatical thinking.
